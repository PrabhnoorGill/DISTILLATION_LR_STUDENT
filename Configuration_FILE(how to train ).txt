Teacher Path (--teacher_pth_path): Update this argument to the correct relative or absolute path to your RealESRGAN-X4.pth file (e.g., ../Real-ESRGAN/weights/RealESRGAN-X4.pth if running from RealESRGAN_Distillation folder).

LR Data Path (--lr_data_dir): Update this to the path containing your real-world LR images for training.

Teacher/Student Config (--teacher_num_feat, --teacher_num_block, --student_num_feat, --student_num_block): Make sure the teacher parameters match your loaded .pth file. Adjust the student parameters to make it smaller/faster if desired.

Distillation Layers (--teacher_layers, --student_layers): This is THE MOST CRITICAL PART.

You need to inspect the actual layer names in both your instantiated teacher and student models. You can do this by adding temporary print statements like print(teacher_model) or iterating through teacher_model.named_modules() before the training loop starts.

Provide the exact names as arguments. For example:

--teacher_layers body.5.rdb1.conv1 body.10.rdb1.conv1 body.15.rdb1.conv1 \
--student_layers body.2.rdb1.conv1 body.4.rdb1.conv1 body.6.rdb1.conv1
Use code with caution.
Bash
The number of layers in --teacher_layers and --student_layers MUST match, and they should represent semantically corresponding points in the networks. Feature shapes MUST also match for the L1/MSE loss to work directly.

Hyperparameters: Adjust --epochs, --batch_size, --learning_rate, --lambda_feature etc., based on your dataset size, hardware, and experimental results.
