# RealESRGAN_Distillation/requirements.txt

# Core deep learning framework (Install PyTorch separately using official instructions!)
# See: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Ensure you match your CUDA version (e.g., pytorch-cuda=12.1 for driver 12.2)
# torch>=1.10 # Example, actual install handles this
# torchvision>=0.11 # Example, actual install handles this
# torchaudio>=0.10 # Example, actual install handles this

# Essential framework dependencies for ESRGAN architecture and utilities
basicsr>=1.4.0

# Image processing library
Pillow>=9.0.0

# Progress bar (optional but used in the refined train script)
tqdm>=4.60.0

# --- Notes ---
# 1. **PyTorch Installation:** This file intentionally doesn't list torch, torchvision, torchaudio
#    for direct pip installation because installing the correct version with CUDA support
#    is critical and best done via the official PyTorch Conda or pip commands.
#    Users MUST install PyTorch separately first, matching their hardware (CUDA version).
#
# 2. **Basicsr Dependencies:** The 'basicsr' package will pull in other necessary
#    dependencies like numpy, pyyaml, opencv-python, scipy, etc.
#
# 3. **Standard Libraries:** Python standard libraries (os, time, argparse, traceback, etc.)
#    are not listed here as they are part of the Python installation.
#
# --- How to Use ---
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment (e.g., conda create -n myenv python=3.10; conda activate myenv).
# 2. Install PyTorch separately following official instructions (matching CUDA version!).
# 3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
